# Privacy Policy for YouTube Delocaliser (YTD)

# Privacy Policy for YouTube Delocaliser (YTD)

**Last updated:** 19.04.2025

YouTube Delocaliser (YTD) is a Firefox extension that replaces the localised titles of YouTube videos with their original, delocalised versions using the YouTube Data API. YouTube may automatically translate video titles into your preferred language, and this behaviour cannot be disabled by users. YTD attempts to reverse this by showing the original titles instead. However, since it cannot distinguish between manually written and automatically translated titles, it delocalises all titles it encounters. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the [YouTube API Services Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies).

## What data does YTD access?

- **Video Information**: YTD retrieves public video metadata (such as original titles) using the YouTube Data API.  
- **Sign-in Permission**: YTD asks you to sign in with your Google account so it can access video information.

## How is your data used?

- The extension uses the token solely to fetch delocalised titles of YouTube videos.  
- No personal data (e.g. account details, subscriptions, watch history) is accessed or collected.  
- Metadata is used only to replace localised titles while browsing YouTube.

## Data storage and caching

- Retrieved video metadata is **cached in the extensionâ€™s local storage** to reduce API usage and improve performance.  
- The cached data remains **on your device only** and is not transmitted to any external server.  
- OAuth tokens are stored **only in memory** and cleared when the browser session ends.

## Data sharing

- No data is sold, shared, or transmitted to third parties.  
- YTD does not use any data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.

## User control and transparency

- You control when and whether to authorise access via OAuth.  
- You can revoke access at any time through your [Google account permissions page](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).  
- The extension functions only with your explicit consent.

## Compliance

- YTD adheres to the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and the [YouTube API Services Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies), including the **Limited Use** policy.  
- Data is accessed and used strictly for the core functionality of displaying delocalised titles.
